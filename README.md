## Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Intro to HTML

Welcome to your repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

之前看github FB po這個課程，覺得挺有趣的html並不是重點

而是你可以跟機器人互動


練習在github上合併(自己合併機器人的PR)、直接commit（commit機器人的檔案）

阿撕~可以過過管理一個倉庫的乾癮XDD

趕緊到https://lab.github.com/courses看看吧

還有很多好玩的
